# MUI React Component Library

## Introduction

This project is a React Component Library built using React Storybook and Material-UI. The library provides a collection of reusable and customizable components that adhere to the Material-UI design system. Storybook is used to develop and document these components in isolation, ensuring a streamlined development and testing process.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: A set of React components designed to be reusable across various projects.
- **Material-UI Integration**: Components are styled using Material-UI, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
- **Storybook Documentation**: Each component is documented and can be viewed in isolation using Storybook.
- **Customizability**: Components can be easily customized to fit the needs of different projects.

## Installation

To install the component library, you need to have Node.js and Yarn installed. You can then install the library by running:

```bash
yarn add mui-react-component-library
```

## Usage
To use a component from the library, simply import it into your jsx file as shown below:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { YourComponent } from './YourComponent';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <YourComponent />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts using Yarn:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. 

### `yarn eject`

Ejects the app configuration. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project.

### `yarn storybook`

Runs the Storybook in development mode. Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser. Storybook is a UI development environment that allows you to develop components in isolation.

### `yarn build-storybook`

Builds the Storybook for production to the `storybook-static` folder. This build can be deployed to any static site hosting service.
